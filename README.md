# Understanding-and-Predicting-Stroke-Occurrences-in-Imbalanced-Data-LSE-ST310-Project


Repository for the Group Coursework component of ST310, LSE, 2020/2021

Contains all files required for the Understanding and Predicting Stroke Occurences in Imbalanced Data project. This project used both interpretable and highly accurate machine learning models to assess the factors associated with the occurrence of strokes in individuals. The interpretable models used were logistic regression and LASSO regression, whilst the highly accurate models included kernel methods, Random Forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Both oversampling and undersampling were used to rectify the class imbalance. 

The dataset used in this project is the 'Stroke prediction dataset' obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). This dataset is provided in the Data folder.
